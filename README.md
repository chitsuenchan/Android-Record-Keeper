## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
An Android app to log Running and Cycling times. 

## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This is a personal learning project aimed to teach me the tools and technology needed to build a native Android application. As later I would like to deploy an Android application to the Google Play store.
